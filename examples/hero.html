          <p class="lead">Since graduating in 2010, I've been working with a number of teams associated with the UK government's transparency movement - designing and developing web-based visualisations and interfaces for data projects, designing APIs, data modelling and a considerable amount of data wrangling.</p>

<p class="lead">Prior to this, my final year project at university was based on a web application that automatically annotated images with their depictions as well as harnessing linked open data to connect those depictions to their online definitions such as their Wikipedia pages - essentially tagging images with concepts instead of strings. I explored new types of interfaces that dealt with semantically enriched data and how information retrieval systems might benefit from the use of semantic data. The interfaces for my project were well received and I was hired as a government contractor just after graduating for a project using semantic data.</p>

<p class="lead">It's been two years now - developing visualisations and interfaces - and I feel as though I'm interested in more than what the government can currently offer in terms of new projects. The projects also tend to have a mixture of underlying issues with clarity, funding and management due to - in my opinion - it being a rather volatile time for data and transparency within government and on the most-part, have been unsuccessful at justifying the government's efforts in releasing large amounts of data to the public. It's not that these projects have been a waste of time - they just haven't hit the right note internally or externally despite creating wonderful things for the community along the way. I want to proceed to work on these projects as they show a lot of promise and good progress has been made with funding and engagement - but having a course like this running in parallel would be hugely beneficial to me.</p>

<p class="lead">The multimedia and interaction modules at university helped me establish the areas of computing I was interested in - HCI, design, networks, audio and vision. I find connecting the virtual to the physical fascinating and this course looks like a great foundation for researching into what information lies among ourselves and our surroundings. It also draws on most of the areas I'm interested in, so I'm excited I've found a course that's locally run and that suits my interests so well. I wanted to continue with studies after graduating, but once presented with an interesting first project - I was happy thinking about what to specialise in while I worked.</p>

<p class="lead">I have a relevant publication to my name; "org: Publishing government organizational information as linked data" - Dave Reynolds, Jeni Tennison, Dan Smith, John Sheridan. It details a real-world example of the processes behind collecting, modelling, publishing and visualising government organisational data as a result of a project run by the Cabinet Office and The National Archives.</p>

<p class="lead">My application is for September 2012 and I am self-funded.</p>
